### Text-to-Speech (TTS) API Documentation

This document provides detailed information on three different Text-to-Speech (TTS) endpoints created using FastAPI, utilizing three TTS libraries: **Pyttsx3**, **gTTS**, and **PlayHT**.

---

### 1) **Pyttsx3-based TTS Endpoint (Free)**

#### Endpoint:
`GET /text-to-speech`

#### Description:
This endpoint converts the provided text into speech using the **pyttsx3** library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. The speech is generated based on a selected voice and returned as an audio file (MP3 format).

#### Query Parameters:
- **`text`** (string, required): The text to be converted to speech.
- **`voice_id`** (integer, optional): The ID of the voice to use (default: `1`). Voice ID corresponds to available voices in the pyttsx3 engine. Voice IDs are typically 0 for male and 1 for female voices, but this may vary.

#### Example Request:
```
GET /text-to-speech?text=Hello%20World&voice_id=1
```

#### Response:
- **200 OK**: A `.mp3` file containing the speech.
  - **Content-Type**: `audio/mp3`
  - **Filename**: `output.mp3`
  
- **400 Bad Request**: If the provided `voice_id` is invalid.
  - Example: 
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Invalid voice ID."
    }
    ```

#### Usage:
- The API will check if the provided `voice_id` is valid based on the list of voices in pyttsx3. If the ID is valid, the speech will be generated and returned as a downloadable MP3 file.
- The temporary file (`output.mp3`) is automatically deleted upon shutdown.

### 2) **gTTS-based TTS Endpoint (Free)**

#### Endpoint:
`GET /text-to-speech`

#### Description:
This endpoint converts the provided text into speech using the **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech) library. It supports various languages and accents for speech generation.

#### Query Parameters:
- **`text`** (string, required): The text to be converted to speech.
- **`lang`** (string, optional): The language code to be used for speech. Defaults to `"en_us"`. Available language codes include:
  - `"en_us"`: English (US)
  - `"en_uk"`: English (UK)
  - `"es"`: Spanish
  - `"fr"`: French
  - `"de"`: German
  
#### Example Request:
```
GET /text-to-speech?text=Hola%20Mundo&lang=es
```

#### Response:
- **200 OK**: A `.mp3` file containing the speech.
  - **Content-Type**: `audio/mp3`
  - **Filename**: `output.mp3`
  
- **400 Bad Request**: If the provided `lang` parameter is not supported.
  - Example: 
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Language 'de_us' not supported. Available options: en_us, en_uk, es, fr, de"
    }
    ```

#### Usage:
- The API will check if the provided `lang` is supported. If supported, it generates speech using gTTS and returns the MP3 file.
- The temporary file (`output.mp3`) is automatically deleted upon shutdown.

### 3) **PlayHT-based TTS Endpoint (Paid)**

#### Endpoint:
`GET /text-to-speech`

#### Description:
This endpoint converts the provided text into speech using **PlayHT**, a high-quality TTS service. The speech is generated using a PlayHT voice ID and returned as an audio file (WAV format).

#### Query Parameters:
- **`text`** (string, required): The text to be converted to speech.
- **`voice_id`** (string, optional): The PlayHT voice ID (default: `s3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/775ae416-49bb-4fb6-bd45-740f205d20a1/jennifersaad/manifest.json`). The voice ID should start with `s3://` to indicate a PlayHT-compatible voice.

#### Example Request:
```
GET /text-to-speech?text=Hello%20PlayHT&voice_id=s3://voice-cloning-zero-shot/775ae416-49bb-4fb6-bd45-740f205d20a1/jennifersaad/manifest.json
```

#### Response:
- **200 OK**: A `.wav` file containing the speech.
  - **Content-Type**: `audio/wav`
  - **Filename**: `output_jenn.wav`

- **400 Bad Request**: If the provided `voice_id` does not start with `s3://`.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "Invalid voice_id format. It should start with 's3://'."
    }
    ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**: If there is any error with generating the speech.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "An error occurred: [error_message]"
    }
    ```

#### Usage:
- The API ensures that the `voice_id` starts with `s3://`, which is the required format for PlayHT's voice IDs.
- It uses PlayHTâ€™s SDK to generate the audio and returns the resulting `.wav` file.
- The temporary file is stored in a non-volatile location and deleted when the process is finished.

---

### General Notes for All Endpoints:

- **Security**: Ensure that any API keys or sensitive data are properly stored in environment variables and not hardcoded in the code.
- **File Cleanup**: All endpoints clean up temporary files after the API shuts down, so no unnecessary files are left on the server.
- **Error Handling**: The API returns relevant error messages when input parameters are incorrect or unsupported, ensuring the user knows how to correct them.

By using these endpoints, users can easily convert any text to speech with a variety of languages, accents, and voices, all while receiving the output as a downloadable audio file for further use.
